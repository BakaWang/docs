# Copy Files and Folders Between Servers

## Copying Files Directly on the Server

This is supported for the following protocols

- [Azure](../Protocols/Azure.md)
- [OpenStack Swift](../Protocols/OpenStack/index.md)
- [WebDAV](../Protocols/WebDAV/index.md)
- [Amazon S3](../Protocols/S3/index.md)
- [iRODS](../Protocols/iRODS.md)

## Copying Files Using Download and Upload

[FTP](../Protocols/FTP.md) and [SFTP](../Protocols/SFTP.md) do not support a copy operation. 

```{important}
Transfer speed depends on your local connectivity as files are routed through your computer for transfer between the remote servers.
```
